# Heart-Disease-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Heart Disease Dataset for predictive healthcare insights.


ðŸ“Š This project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Heart Disease dataset.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
- Performed statistical analysis
- Visualized correlations and distributions
- Highlighted key features influencing heart disease

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ”¹ How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/Heart-Disease-EDA.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA_FOR_heart.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Found strong correlations between `cholesterol`, `age`, and heart disease.
- Visualization insights included feature distributions and risk factors.
